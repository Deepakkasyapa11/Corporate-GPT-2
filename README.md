This project aims to develop a powerful large language model, which will act as an intelligent chat bot system designed to cater to the requirements of the academic community. The below objectives are: 

1. To identify the deep learning model to be applied in the proposed system.

2. To develop the front-end (flutter) and back-end(Fast-Api) interface for the proposed chat-bot system.

3. To conduct user testing that allows users to evaluate the system and give feedback.
